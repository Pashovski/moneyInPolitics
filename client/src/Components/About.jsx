            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to make you a more informed voter! Money has the power to influence legislation and even elections. By exploring our app you will be able to see where legislators are getting their contributions. How these legislators then vote will influence policy changes perhaps in the favor of those who are giving. Make youself a more informed voter by following the money.</p>

            <h3>Born from Curiosity</h3>
            <p>Although much of this information found on this site can be accessed in many places on the internet, we wanted to provide voters with a synthesized collection of current legislaters and thier top contributors. Where a legislator is getting their contributions and in what amounts may better inform you, the voter, of the policy changes this legislator may be in favor of. Money talks, right? Find out what legislators have sold their votes. </p>
